## MONIKA MOŻDŻEŃ PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

Repository with the source code of a project I implemented for Monika Możdżeń, Warsaw-based interior designer (shared with Cilent's permission).

## Why is it here? 
In this project, the elegant and understated visual design is mirrored by the lightweight implementation, with minimal JS use (and maximum Lighthouse score in mind).
I am really proud of a few visual tricks (such as asymmetric logo placement resulting in an illusion of symmetry) that I was able to get into the final design.

##### **Stack:**
##### Bootstrap 5, minimum JavaScript
